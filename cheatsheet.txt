This is my cheat sheet.

ls - list
cd - change directory
cd .. - go up one level
cd ~ - go home!
tab - the best key ever, it auto completes names.
mkdir - create a new folder
echo - echo echo echo
cat - it prints whatever is in the file. 
q = interrups the output from commmand (if too long)
command + k - clears last screen
command l - clears last command
uniq - unique entries (non duplicates)
> - redirect or create file if no file with that name
grep - search
-i - ignore capitalization
